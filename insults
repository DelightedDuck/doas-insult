My pet ferret can type better than you!
Just what do you think you're doing Dave?
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
Are you on drugs?
Your mind just hasn't been the same since the electro-shock, has it?
You can't come in. Our tiger has got flu
You do that again and see what happens...
I wish to make a complaint.
Hold it up to the light --- not a brain in sight!
I've seen penguins that can type better than that.
Listen, burrito brains, I don't have time to listen to this trash.
I fart in your general direction!
I'm very sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.
And you call yourself a Rocket Scientist!
My mind is going. I can feel it.
Take a stress pill and think things over.
It can only be attributed to human error.
Where did you learn to type?
Maybe if you used more than just two fingers...
You type like i drive.
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
Speak English you fool --- there are no subtitles in this scene.
